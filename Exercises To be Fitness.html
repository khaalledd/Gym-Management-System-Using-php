    <h1>Exercises To be Fitness</h1>
    <p>You probably have a vague sense that exercise is good for you—and you’ve probably heard that it’s “healthy for
        the heart.” But if you’re like most people, that’s not enough motivation to get you to break a sweat with any
        regularity. As I report in the TIME cover story, “The Exercise Cure,” only 20% of Americans get the recommended
        150 minutes of strength and cardiovascular physical activity per week, more than half of all baby boomers report
        doing no exercise whatsoever, and 80.2 million Americans over age 6 are entirely inactive.</p>
    <p>Exercise is great for your brain.

        It’s linked to less depression, better memory and quicker learning. Studies also suggest that exercise is, as of
        now, the best way to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, a major fear for many Americans.

        Scientists don’t know exactly why exercise changes the structure and function of the brain, but it’s an area of
        active research. So far, they’ve found that exercise improves blood flow to the brain, feeding the growth of new
        blood vessels and even new brain cells, thanks to the protein BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). BDNF
        triggers the growth of new neurons and helps repair and protect brain cells from degeneration. It may also help
        people focus, according to recent research.

    <p>You might get happier.

        Countless studies show that many types of exercise, from walking to cycling, make people feel better and can
        even relieve symptoms of depression. Exercise triggers the release of chemicals in the brain—serotonin,
        norepinephrine, endorphins, dopamine—that dull pain, lighten mood and relieve stress. “For years we focused
        almost exclusively on the physical benefits of exercise and really have ignored the psychological and emotional
        benefits of being regularly active,” says Cedric Bryant, chief science officer of the American Council on
        Exercise.</p>
    <p>It might make you age slower.

        Exercise has been shown to lengthen lifespan by as much as five years. A small new study suggests that
        moderate-intensity exercise may slow down the aging of cells. As humans get older and their cells divide over
        and over again, their telomeres—the protective caps on the end of chromosomes—get shorter. To see how exercise
        affects telomeres, researchers took a muscle biopsy and blood samples from 10 healthy people before and after a
        45-minute ride on a stationary bicycle. They found that exercise increased levels of a molecule that protects
        telomeres, ultimately slowing how quickly they shorten over time. Exercise, then, appears to slow aging at the
        cellular level.</p>
    <p>It’ll make your skin look better.

        Aerobic exercise revs up blood flow to the skin, delivering oxygen and nutrients that improve skin health and
        even help wounds heal faster. “That’s why when people have injuries, they should get moving as quickly as
        possible—not only to make sure the muscle doesn’t atrophy, but to make sure there’s good blood flow to the
        skin,” says Anthony Hackney, an exercise physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Train
        long enough, and you’ll add more blood vessels and tiny capillaries to the skin, too.

        The skin also serves as a release point for heat. (See “Why Does My Face Turn Red When I Exercise?” for more on
        that.) When you exercise, your muscles generate a lot of heat, which you have to give up to the environment so
        your body temperature doesn’t get too high, Hackney says. The heat in the muscle transfers to the blood, which
        shuttles it to the skin; it can then escape into the atmosphere.</p>
