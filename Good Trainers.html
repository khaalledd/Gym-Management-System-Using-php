<h1>Goog Trainers</h1>
<p>Whether you conduct online or offline training, its success depends on many factors, like the quality of learning
    material, an understanding of the audience, relevance to the training and job needs, etc. However, there is a secret
    ingredient to effective training which is often underestimated – a trainer’s professionalism. This is a set of
    professional qualities of a good trainer which empowers them to communicate knowledge, support learners, and take
    responsibility for the result.</p>
<p>The Core Qualities of a Good Trainer
    Before you dive into the six core qualities of an effective corporate trainer and reflect on them with our guests,
    you can test yourself a little with the checklist below. It contains the traits that we’ll examine in this article.
    See if you tick all the boxes! It’s OK if some of them are empty so far – feel free to skip to the ones you need and
    get ideas on how to improve them.</p>
<p>They are effective facilitators
    Training is not the same as didactic teaching. It is the learners’ needs, peculiarities, and objectives that
    trainers have in focus – not giving lectures from textbooks. They guide learners on how to accomplish training
    objectives, notice group dynamics and learners’ progress, and manage the training event. That’s facilitation.

    Roy Pollock, Chief Learning Officer at The 6Ds Company, emphasizes that good trainers are more than just a “sage on
    the stage,” and that they should operate with a learner-centered approach.</p>
<p>They are great communicators
    Trainers are able to maintain a dialogue with various participants and groups of learners. Their strong
    communication and interpersonal skills help them attract and maintain attention, break the ice, shift the focus of
    learners when needed, and be heard by the audience. A successful trainer is also good at nonverbal communication,
    including body language, which helps to indicate people’s moods, attitudes, and psychological blocks that hinder
    development.

    Dave Potter, Director of Training and Development at Triad Unlimited, points out that a good trainer should possess
    and master many communication methods:

    Assessing the par</p>
<p>They are mature
    It may seem that a good trainer is a superhuman who demonstrates supremacy in skills, character traits, knows
    everything about business or life success, and acts like an unattainable ideal. But, in fact, trainers are people
    too. They also have strengths and weaknesses. The thing is that a good trainer is a mature person who has
    confidence, high self-esteem, and doesn’t need to assert themself at the expense of others for the sake of always
    being right.</p>
