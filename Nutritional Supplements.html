<h1>Nutritional Supplements</h1>
<p>Editor's choice: nutrition and perception
    The way we experience food and drink has a big impact on our choices. Seemingly minor details in the preparation and
    presentation of meals can change food texture, taste, and nutritional content. With so many variables and the
    potential impact they can make, research can help to guide recipe changes, preparation steps and sensory
    experiences. This Collection brings together some of our most recent papers on the subject of food preparation and
    perception.</p>
<p>This study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of use of dietary supplements (DSs) among gym users and gym
    instructors involved in body shaping-oriented fitness training. Furthermore, this study aimed to verify whether
    differences existed in the prevalence and in the types of DSs used in both gym users and gym instructors involved in
    body shaping-oriented fitness competitions vs. those not involved in fitness competitions. A survey was distributed
    to 316 participants, composed of 89 gym instructors and 227 gym users of both genders aged 27.3 ± 7.7. Among these
    participants, 52 were involved in competitions and 248 were not, while 16 participants did not specify either way.
    The results showed a high prevalence in the use of DSs in the population considered, with 85.4% of the participants
    declaring they used DSs, with high heterogeneity in the numbers and in the combinations used. No differences were
    found between gym instructors and gym users, or between participants involved and those not involved in
    competitions. The results indicate that DSs are widely used by persons involved in body shaping-oriented fitness
    training. The results also suggest that the majority of the participants decided individually which DSs to use.</p>
<p>Dietary supplements (DSs) are products consumed in addition to a regular diet [1]. These products may include
    vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and a variety of other molecules. DSs are foodstuffs, but sometimes their
    commercialized pharmaceutical forms may be misleading for consumers, and consequently erroneously considered
    medicinal products. Additionally, the legislation regulating supplements is unclear, with discrepancies, for
    example, between regulations adopted in the USA, and regulations applied in the different countries within the
    European Union [2].</p>
<p>In total, 398 persons met the inclusion criteria; 82 persons refused to be involved in the study, and 316 persons
    declared their willingness to take part and signed an informed consent. The 316 participants who met the inclusion
    criteria and volunteered for this study were aged 27.3 ± 7.7 years old, with a range of 18 to 54 years old. There
    were 89 gym trainers (28.2% of the sample) and 227 gym users with no experience as instructors (71.8%). There were
    52 participants involved in body shaping-oriented fitness competitions (16.5%) with 248 participants not involved in
    competitions (78.5%), and 16 participants (5.1%) who did not respond to the question. Of the participants, 83 were
    female (26.3%), and 233 were male (73.7%), with an average volume of training of 6.95 ± 3.08 h/week. In total, 192
    participants were involved in weight training (60.8% of the sample), 111 in mixed training, including both weight
    and aerobic training (35.1% of the sample), and only 8 were involved in solely aerobic training (2.5% of the
    sample).</p>
